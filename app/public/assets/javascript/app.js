// Convert each user's results into an array of numbers
let userResults = []

// Compare difference between current user's scores against the other users
// questions by questions.

// Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference

// Use absolute value of the differences. No negative solutions

// closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference

// Once you've found the current user's compatible friend, display the
// result as a modal pop-up

// Click submit and show me my friend match

// The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match
